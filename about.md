## Who am I?

My name is Zachary Joswick. Im an engineer originally from florida but current residing in Virginia. I've always had a passion for robotics, and I somehow managed to turn that passion into a career.

### What do you mean by "Full Stack Robotics Engineer"

Realistically, it means that im to blame whenever something goes wrong on a project, no matter what's broken. Essentially, I have worked in all areas of robotic development, from design, to electronics, to mechanical design and manufacturing, to software development, to devops. For many projects, i can take the concept and turn it into a production ready system. Granted, im by no means an industry leading expert in any of these areas, but given a bit of time, there's little i cant eventually figure out.
